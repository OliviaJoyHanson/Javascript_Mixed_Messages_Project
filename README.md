# Javascript_Mixed_Messages_Project

## Hello! This is a Javascript project that I did for my codecademy course.
### This is an ad lib generator with 3 phrases that all include placeholders for a noun, adverb, and verb. The program parses through these phrases, the placeholders are all replaced with a randomly chosen word from an array of each word-type, then the parsed phrase is joined and there you have a randomized ad lib!
### Methods used: 
* Math.random()
* Math.floor()
* .split()
* .forEach()
* .indexOf()
* .join()

#### Thank you for checking out this project.
